         * Introduction to Graphs
         * 
         * A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect these vertices.
         * Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles and more complex relationships between elements.
         * 
         * Key Components:
         * - Vertex/Node: An entity in the graph (can represent anything - cities, people, etc.)
         * - Edge: A connection between two vertices (can represent relationships, distances, etc.)
         * 
         * Types of Graphs:
         * 1. Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have directions
         * 2. Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction
         * 3. Weighted Graph: Edges have weights/costs associated with them
         * 4. Unweighted Graph: All edges have the same weight/importance
         * 
         * Common Graph Representations:
         * 1. Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where matrix[i][j] represents an edge from vertex i to j
         * 2. Adjacency List: An array of lists where each list contains the neighbors of a vertex
         * 
         * Common Graph Algorithms:
         * - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors before moving to next level
         * - Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking
         * - Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices
         * - Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Finds shortest paths and can handle negative edge weights
         * - Kruskal's & Prim's Algorithms: Find Minimum Spanning Trees
         * 
         * Applications:
         * - Social Networks
         * - Maps and Navigation
         * - Network Routing
         * - Recommendation Systems
         * - Game Development (for pathfinding)
