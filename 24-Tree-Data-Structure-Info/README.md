# Tree Data Structure

A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has a
value and zero or more child nodes. The topmost node is called the root node.

Trees are used to represent a wide range of data structures, such as:

* File systems
* Databases
* Domain Name System (DNS)
* HTML Document Object Model (DOM)

**Terminology**:

* **Subtree**: A subtree is a smaller tree within a larger tree.
* **Size**: The size of a tree is the number of nodes it contains.
* **Depth**: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root node to that
  node.
* **Height**: The height of a node is the number of edges from that node to the
  nearest leaf node.
